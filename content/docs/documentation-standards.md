This document outlines guidelines on how to document code, projects, and processes effectively. Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for the understanding and future maintenance of our projects.

## 1. Code Documentation

In [code-conventions.md](code-conventions.md) we have established code conventions. Additionally, code documentation should adhere to the following standards:

- **Comments:** Use comments sparingly and aim for self-explanatory code. Only include comments for complex algorithms or to clarify non-obvious code sections.

- **Inline Documentation:** Use inline documentation tools if applicable (e.g., JSDoc for JavaScript).

## 2. Project Documentation

Proper project documentation is essential for onboarding and maintaining projects. Follow these standards:

- **README.md:** Each project MUST have a comprehensive README.md covering project overview, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

- **Wiki:** Consider using the repository's wiki for in-depth documentation, guides, and tutorials.

- **Architecture Diagrams:** If applicable, include high-level architecture diagrams to aid understanding.

## Contributing to Documentation Standards

If you have suggestions or improvements for these documentation standards, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions help maintain clear and effective documentation across our projects.
